API tutorial with python and FAttAPI 
In this miin-project i built some end-points for connecting to SQLite 

End-point NO1 : #add
  getting two Parameters {num1/num2} and INSERT them into Numbers table
    as a reusult it returns a value of num1/num2

End-point NO2 : #update
  getting three Parameters {id/num1/num2}
    it checks if the DB has the id and then update num1 & num2 value
